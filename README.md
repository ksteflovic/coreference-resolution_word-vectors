# Coreference Resolution for Improving Performance Measures of Classification Tasks

This repository contains the code for a research project focusing on coreference resolution in the field of natural language processing (NLP). The goal of the project was to investigate the impact of coreference resolution on classification of fake news. The research aimed to determine whether coreferencing the input data before classification is more effective than classifying them without coreference.
